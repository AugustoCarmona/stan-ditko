### Implemented features
- When you enter the web app for the first time without any character in the URL, the site shows a random character (in the form of a hero) and so on every time you reload the page.
- The search contemplate looking for text similarities and name similarities, but only returns the first character result.
- The way in which the searches are shown is in the form of cards and modals for the detail of the character and the comics.
- Clicking on a card shows the detail of the character and shows a list of his comics.

### Features that need to be implemented
- Not implemented due to lack of time
 - Character searches by url
 - The search must have the possibility to search by comic directly.
 - The search should be able to be saved in a favorites list.
- The search should contemplate looking for text similarities and name similarities, but rendering a series of similar characters.
